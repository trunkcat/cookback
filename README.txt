=== COOOK ======================================================================

A work-in-progress cooking game project.

== DESCRIPTION =================================================================

(To be added later)

== TODOS & ROADMAP (v0) ========================================================

Detailed descriptions will be added later.

- Setup the HTTP server
- Finish database schema
- Decide what to store and where
- Registration & Authentication
- Websocket connection

=== DEVELOPER NOTES ============================================================

If this ends up as a game with online multiplayer as planned, then, the game
needs to be a fully online game, including saves and progress. Another option is
to make the game offline and with offline LAN support. But that would destroy
the online thing we need for the DBMS project.
